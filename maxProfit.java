/*This approach works by taking advantage of every small increase in stock price. Instead of trying to guess the best single day to 
buy and sell, we simply buy whenever the price goes up the next day and sell  immediately to lock in that profit. 
By repeating this for every upward movement, we collect all the small gains, which together give us the maximum possible profit 
if weâ€™re allowed to trade as often as we like. */
